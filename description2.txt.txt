B3. Creating two equivalent web pages and access the same. First should result in proper content 
    type and thus it should be displayed properly in the browser. The 2nd web page though having 
    content should display the content in raw format without any formatting.These web pages could 
    be.html or .jpg files etc.
WORK DONE DETAILS:
First.html  is resulting in the formatted data 
second.html is resulting in the raw data
    

we used html for creating the webpages.
In the first one we used  html code  for creating, formatting and changing the background colours   
and in  Second one, the raw input we used  to display the formatted text on first.html is displayed in the second.html file.
the raw data is displayed usinf <xmp> command
    The respective output present in the  first.html and second.html,the first resulting in the proper
    data and the second resulting in the raw data .the link is provided between both the webpages. 
    using button we created the link between first and second, when you click the continue button on first webpage
    it takes you to the second webpage.

problems:
while doing for the .jpg files,we werent able to display the raw data.
