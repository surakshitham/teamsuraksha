A8.Implement web access including redirect.
   Write a web client to access a webpage on a web server (e.g. cse.ksit.edu.in). If the server redirects
   the request to another URL using status code 301 or 302, then client should access the new URL.
   Repeat the process till status code received is 200 or 403 or 404.Save the content of the received file
   in your local directory as per path given in the redirected URL and also note down the Last-Modified header
   for this file. The program should not use any URL library,but should use HTTP protocol headers directly as per specs.
   The program should accept following parameter
   a. URL

   The submission should include tcpdump of communication and saved file using redirect.

work done:Server.java
          HttpRedirectExample.java
     Server.java will connect the server to port 80.
     HttpRedirectExample.java will redirect according to the status code
    we developed a program to access web server by web client.we accessed a webpage using status code 301 or 302. 
if these status codes are peresnt then it should access the new url. these process repeats until it reaches status code 200.
   and displaying the modified the last date of the webserver.
This takes URL as parameter.
   

Problems:
      we didnt understand how to do http protocols headers directly,tcpdump through the program.
